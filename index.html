        <h3>Important Message to the Lakeland, Florida Community</h3>
        <p>At this time, Rapture Guns & Knives would like to thank the Polk County Sheriff’s Office for their quick response to the unfortunate incident at our location on the morning of January 1, 2017.
        </p>

        <p>We understand the nervousness of the community and we share your concern. We are fully cooperating with all law enforcement agencies and we truly hope for the apprehension and prosecution of all parties involved. We do take the security of our store very seriously and we have complied with all ATF requirements such as: security bars on all windows and doors, concrete pillars in the front, and more security cameras.</p>

        <p>Since we opened our doors, law enforcement officers have been some of our best patrons and we have consulted with some of them on ways to best protect our inventory. We have consulted with ATF, law enforcement agencies, and other gun store owners in the past and asked about installing roll-up doors and steel cables and were advised against it. </p> 

        <p>The reason being is because any responding officers wouldn’t be able to have a clear view of the inside of the building and steel cables may lead to the possibility of a larger theft (grab the cable and run, thus taking all firearms).</p>

        <p>Also, we are looking into why our security company delayed their response in contacting the authorities, especially given the time that this crime happened. In closing, we have the utmost respect for the Polk County Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff Judd; however, the quotes in the statement that he gave to the media were not from the owner of Rapture Guns & Knives and have been addressed with the employee that spoke with them back in December.</p>

        <p>We will not be making anymore statements or answering any questions from the media, since details were left out of the story and we do not want to hinder the investigation. Thank you</p>
