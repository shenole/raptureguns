        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <img src="images/storePic01.jpg" id="storePic01" alt="store_view"/>
        <p>Our beginnings is about people coming together. Richard, the gun and knifesmith here at the store, had been working out of his garage for years and had managed to build an enviable reputation as a fine craftsman. He had all the tools and skill to turn out fantastic work at home, but his goal was to be able to one day work out of a storefront.</p>

        <p>On the flip side of things there was me and my dad. Since I was 5 years old, I helped my dad man the table he would set up at gun shows and conventions. Working with my dad is of course how I developed my enthusiasm for firearms.</p>

        <p>As a little side note, one thing about working the gun show and convention circuit for so many years is that it helped us cultivate strong relationships with a wide range of different companies in the firearms industry. Having those relationships would prove to be a real handy thing when it became time to try our hands at an actual storefront.</p>

        <p>Moving on with the story, Richard had become acquainted with me and my dad at church. Over time, one thing led to another and before you knew it, we had decided to come together to open a store. Creating a storefront was a big step! But with my family having a history of 4 generations here in North Lakeland, we felt we were kind of in a unique position to understand how the hunters and firearm enthusiasts of our community were under served, due to the lack of any gun stores in our community.</p>

        <p>We officially opened our doors as Rapture Guns & Knives in 2012. And because of both the solid reputation Richard had built as a top-notched gun and knifesmith, and those strong relationships and connections I mentioned earlier that my dad and I had developed with so many companies in the industry, we were able to hit the ground running by having the ability to acquire virtually anything our customers were looking forâ€¦ be it gun or kife.</p>

        <p>The staff and I are proud of the reputation we have built as a place where hunters and enthusiasts can come in, feel comfortable, enjoy the experience of learning about and purchasing guns and knives, or even teaching us a thing or two from their own wealth of knowledge, while not feeling any pressure to have to buy something from us.</p>

        <p>Our regulars know that we are enthusiasts and we invite you to stop by and find that out for yourself!</p>
