        <h3>Guns</h3>
        <p>Yes, we sell guns. But we also buy guns, do trade-ins, provide a lay-away option, and we have the ability to order practically any firearm or accessory that you've ever heard of. And, because we have a rotating inventory to keep a fresh look about the place, you will want to stop by regularly to see what's new at the store.</p>
<!-- The three different categories of guns are displayed here -->
        <div class="columnsWeapons">        
        <div id="weaponColumn1">
            <h4>Rifles</h4>
            <a href="rifles.html"><img src="images/rifleButton.jpg" width="100%" alt="bifles"/></a>
            <p>rifles are the gun world's work horse. Whatever you're looking for... a far reaching bolt action rifle, a nostalgic lever action rifle, a reliable .22, a solid battle rifle... we can help you acquire the right tool for the task at hand.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="weaponColumn2">
            <h4>Handguns</h4>
            <a href="handguns.html"><img src="images/handgunButton.jpg" width="100%" alt="handbuns"/></a>
            <p>So many handguns, so little time! Double action, single action, striker firer, revolver, polymer, full size, compact, subcompact... is your head spinning yet? If not, then it will be when you visit us and see that we've got them all!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="weaponColumn3">
            <h4>Shotguns</h4>
            <a href="shotguns.html"><img src="images/shotgunButton2.jpg" width="100%" alt="shotbuns"/></a>
            <p>You just can't beat the versatility of a shotgun. By simply changing your ammo, you can go from breeching doors to hunting hogs. You can even have the tactical luxury of switching from lethal to non-lethal capabilities.</p>

        <h3>Ammunition</h3>
        <p>Unless you plan to have the coolest looking paperweight possible, you're going to want to get some ammo to put into that firearm of yours. We carry a wide selection of ammunition brands and calibers for you to "feed the beast".</p>
