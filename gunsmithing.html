            <h3>Gunsmithing</h3>
            <img src="images/gunsmiths1.jpg" alt="gunsmith" width="100%" />
            <p>Let's face it, if it's made by man, at some point in time it will need some kind of repair work, no
                matter how reliable it has otherwise proven to be. For those times when you need the best eyes and
                hands to look at and repair your firearm, there's no gunsmiths better in Lakeland, Florida than our
                guys Richard and Justin.</p>

            <p> Richard has over 15 years of experience under his belt with gunsmithing and the enjoyment he gets from
                working on guns is more than obvious. If it has a trigger and goes "bang", Richard can repair it and
                make it run the way it should.</p>

            <p>Justin is our resident Iraq War veteran and obtained his gunsmithing experience both as a boy working
                with his father on guns and as an armorer for the U.S. Army while overseas serving our country. Battle
                rifles are Justin's specialty.</p>

            <p> Not only are Richard and Justin available to provide you with excellent repair work, they are also
                happy to show you the sort of things to do to keep your firearms in great condition. Stop by and don't
                be afraid to ask them any maintenance or repair questions you may have. Also, feel free to visit us to
                get a free estimate on a repair job.</p>
